# Machine-Learning-Model-Implementations
This repository is a collection of a few machine learning models' implementation from scratch

### Models implemented from scratch:
  * Linear Regression using Ordinary Least Squares method
  * Linear Regression using Gradient Descent method
  * Ridge Regression (Gradient descent with L2 Regularization)
  * K-Nearest Neighbours
  * Naive Bayes
  * K-Fold Cross Validation
